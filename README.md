# QuizPlease?
## QuizPlease? is a web application that provides various functionality to our users.
## **Problems**
### We plan to use our app for various problems and here are some of them:
 - **Lack of mental exercises**. Nowadays we have lots of distracktors and tons of information that flies around. And it's also easy to find anything you want, which makes learning less effective. We think that small quizzes and tests on currently studied topic provide required stress situation for our brains, which will definitely help with learning.
 - **Fear of losing and competitions**. That is actually a pretty common problem of people, since we don't like to lose. But in some ways losing is winning if you keep track of your mistakes and push your boundaries.
 - **Community**. The functionality that we want to provide includes ability of creating a cimmunity of like-minded individuals, which will help with learning certain or new things.

## **Our possible solutions**
 - **Functionality**. We want to provide various functionality, like
    - Quiz/Questions constructor
    - Quiz results
    - Personal statistics
    - Overall ranking system
    - Comments, posts writing
    
## **Our stack**
 - **Backend.** Our team has 2 backenders and we have pretty wide option. But the trick is that we don't know same backend technologies, which makes it difficult for us to decide. We probably will write some services on different languages and then make frontend ask any of them when certain service is required. We are still thinking of which technology shall we use, but our priorities fall to:
    - Ruby
    - Golang
 - **Frontend.** We have 2 people, experienced with same framework, which gave us an easy choice:
    - Vue.js
 - **Database.** Since we have to choose SQL database only, we decided to select the easiest to use, but still high-scalable db:
    - Sqlite3
